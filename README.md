other verifier's that I will probably take inspiration from.

Eventually custom operations will be included. 

# Why Rust

Rust is a very fast language, and I do not like C and C++. 


# Running

Compile it with `cargo build --release`, the binary should be in `/target/release`

Change to the correct directory then do `path/to/binary name-of-mm-file.mm`
